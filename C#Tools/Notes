Need to consider way I can implement a base classe. 
The base class could hold functions for saving, deleteing, and editing similar objects.

Need to look into the concept of 'enum's 
 - seems to have similar sintax to a class, just replace class with enum. 
 - seems to be some sort of stat machine containing different possible statuses.

Consider the ways I can use abstract classes. 
An abstract class can contain incomplete abstract methods which can be overridden. 
I am not sure how this would be more helpfull than just having the method in the derived class. 
Seeing that I will have to build out the logic of the method in the derived class anyway...

Consider how to use a common library to store and reuse a timer component as an extension method.
